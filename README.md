Community made OS for ComputerCraft

I had an idea, when I saw in Idea Exchange someone thought of "SuperOS". It was supposed to be a community made OS.
Though, I think this could be a bit improved. They didn't mention GitHub, which would of been better, and they had the thing planned out pretty much telling people what to do. I wanted mine to be modular, a bit like a normal OS, so you'd have a bunch of different programs or services for different things (eg in mac, you'd have finder which displays background and stuff, and things like that).

#Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this, I guess you could make a pull request. Though, I am a bit new to GitHub. There may be a better way?
Otherwise, I might add a few people to edit code as they wish.

#Contributors
Just me, currently.

Thanks for reading this, I hope a few people will like the idea.
(By the way, I'm new to GitHub, so please feed me with knowledge if you can!)

Warning- I was tired as of writing this. So yeah, don't be surprised if you find any mistakes. I've also read through and edited this for GitHub here.
